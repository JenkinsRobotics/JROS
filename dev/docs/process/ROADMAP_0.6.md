# JROS 0.6 Roadmap — Polished install / update / lifecycle UX

**Status:** active (2026-06-25) — branch opened off 0.5.0
**Branch:** `0.6.0`
**Pre-req:** 0.5.0 shipped + merged to `master` (commit `6c50374`)
**Target:** JROS *feels like a real app* to install, run, and keep current —
including in-app **update checks** and **self-update** (download + apply), not
just a curl one-liner.

## The position

0.5 made the agent visibly alive (animation, personality, skill tree). 0.6
makes the **product around it** feel finished: the install, the update, the
uninstall. The headline is a real update experience — the app knows when a
newer version exists and can pull it down in place, keeping the operator's
`.venv/` and instance state untouched. No "re-paste this curl command."

Renders via `jaeger roadmap` (it picks the highest-numbered ROADMAP).

## Carry-over flags from 0.5.0 — docs accuracy (quick wins)

The README drifted during 0.5.0. Fix first; they're small and load-bearing for
a polished first impression.

- [x] **`jaeger` is the canonical command.** Quick Start + Daily-use now use
  `./jaeger` (with the PATH note for global `jaeger`); `run.sh` kept as an
  alias. "Daily use (0.3.0)" header retitled. *(done)*
- [x] **Wizard now picks a character.** Quick Start documents the character
  pick. *(done)*
- [x] **Upgrade instructions fixed.** README now documents `jaeger update`
  (download/apply, `--rollback`, `--ref`) instead of `git pull && ./install.sh`;
  storage table + prose updated. Version badge bumped 0.3.0 → 0.5.2. *(done)*
  *(Still stale: the `0.3.0`-era Status narrative — a broader content pass,
  not part of this theme.)*

## Install experience

- [x] **Prereq detection + guidance.** scripts/install.sh checks Python
  3.11/3.12 + a C toolchain (macOS `xcode-select -p`; Linux `cc/gcc/clang`) and
  hard-fails early with the exact per-OS fix; PortAudio is a non-fatal Linux
  warning. *(done; the in-repo `install.sh` could mirror the toolchain check.)*
- [ ] **First-run model download** — progress bar + ETA + resumable; surface the
  download size before it starts. *(still open — the one sizable item left.)*
- [x] **Post-install summary** — next-steps output corrected to `jaeger agent
  create` / `jaeger agent list` (+ OS-aware launcher/autostart hints). *(done)*

## Native Mac app — launcher + launch-at-login

The "feels like a real app" track. Two tiers, both layered on **today's curl
install** (the download is unchanged). Tier 2 — the thin launcher in
`/Applications` — is the ceiling; a full self-contained bundle / DMG is **out
of scope** (note below).

**Tier 1 — launch at login (easy, no bundling)** ✅ *done*
- [x] `jaeger autostart enable|disable|status` — macOS writes/loads a
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` LaunchAgent; **Linux** writes a `systemd --user`
  unit (+ best-effort `loginctl enable-linger` for boot-without-login) — the
  unit case the robots need. Runs the install's `jaeger` (extra args forwarded);
  **opt-in**. *(done)*

**Tier 2 — clickable launcher app (the target, no bundling)** ✅ *done*
- [x] **`jaeger launcher install|remove`** drops `/Applications/Jaeger.app`
  (falls back to `~/Applications` if `/Applications` isn't writable) — a thin
  launcher (`Contents/MacOS/Jaeger` stub → the install's `jaeger`) +
  `Info.plist`, registered with LaunchServices. install.sh's next-steps offer
  it. *(done; a custom icon is deferred — generic icon for now.)*
- [x] **No Gatekeeper friction, no signing.** Created *locally* by the verb
  (not downloaded) → no quarantine flag → opens without the "unidentified
  developer" block. No py2app, no notarization. *(done)*
- [x] **File access stays full.** The launcher is *not* sandboxed (no App
  Sandbox entitlement) → the spawned Python has the same Unix file access as
  Terminal; workspace + project edits are unaffected. The only gate is **TCC**
  for protected folders (Desktop / Documents / Downloads / external drives):
  `jaeger doctor` now **detects missing Full Disk Access** (probes a TCC-gated
  path) and points to System Settings → Privacy → Full Disk Access. *(done)*

**Out of scope — full bundle / DMG** (decided 2026-06-25). No self-contained
py2app / PyInstaller `.app`, no signed / notarized DMG, no drag-to-Applications
install. The curl install + thin launcher is the chosen experience; bundling
the runtime + native deps + code-signing / notarization isn't worth it for the
current audience. Revisit only if shipping to people who won't run a one-liner.

## Update experience — the headline

- [x] **`jaeger update`** — one command, in place, **no git required** for the
  clean curl/product install (downloads + applies a release tarball). Dev
  clones still fast-forward via git. *(done)*
- [x] **Check for updates** — `version_check.latest_version` queries GitHub
  tags, numeric-compares to local `__version__`. Shared by update + doctor. *(done)*
- [x] **Download + apply** — fetch the target tag tarball, copy the PRODUCT
  allowlist, swap each item in place (per-item `os.replace`, recoverable via
  the kept prev dir), preserve `.venv/` + `.jaeger_os/`; reinstall deps **only**
  if `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` changed. *(done)*
- [x] **Surface availability in-app** — tray "Check for Updates…" item (checks
  on click, notifies the result) + a Jaeger Studio top banner that auto-checks
  off-thread on open and shows "Update available — X · run jaeger update". Both
  via the shared `version_check.update_status`. *(done)*
- [~] **Channels / pinning** — `jaeger update --ref TAG` pins a version; honour
  `JAEGER_REF` in the env. Stable-vs-latest channel naming not yet formalised.
- [x] **Rollback** — previous product kept in `.update-prev/`;
  `jaeger update --rollback` restores it (one level). *(done)*

> Note: trimmed the git-archive tarball `jaeger update` fetches — untracked
> `avatar/.build/` (93 MB derived Swift cache) **and** `.gitattributes
> export-ignore` on `dev/` + `.github/`. A product-only Release asset could
> shrink it further still.

## Uninstall / reinstall

- [x] **`jaeger uninstall`** — removes the framework (product + `.venv`); keeps
  `.jaeger_os/` (agents) unless `--purge`. Refuses on a dev clone (`.git`).
  `--yes` for non-interactive. *(done)*
- [x] **`jaeger reinstall`** — clean reinstall in place, keeping agents: clean
  install → re-fetch the product (current or `--ref`) + force a dep resync; dev
  clone → repair the editable install. Recovers a broken/half-updated install.
  *(done — operator-requested; closes the curl-reuses-`.venv` gap.)*

## Plumbing

- [x] **Version source of truth** — `jaeger_os.__version__` (now `0.5.2`), and
  pyproject reads it dynamically (no second source). Bump to `0.6.0` when 0.6
  ships.
- [x] **Latest-version lookup** — `jaeger_os/core/version_check.py`, shared by
  the updater + `doctor`. *(done)*
- [x] **`jaeger doctor`** reports current vs. latest (CLI only — the agent's
  `self_check` stays network-free). *(done)*

---

## Also queued (not this theme — don't lose them)

- **Tier-1 `core` role** in the app framework (`JaegerApp` hosts the brain as a
  first-class main-thread core, not a stubbed node) — design already drafted;
  aligns JROS to the demos.
- **JP01 hardware adapter layer** (mic-in / RGB-out / speaker-out streaming on
  the device, riding the `MediaFrame` / `ZmqBus` seam declared in 0.5.0) — see
  [`../hardware/`](../hardware/). HISTORY flagged this for 0.6/0.7; the
  install/update theme takes 0.6, hardware likely lands 0.7.

## Delivered on this branch

The install/update **theme** work, then the agentic pipeline that landed
alongside it. See STATUS.md for the runtime detail.

**Install / update theme:**

- [x] **Update mechanism — clean-install download/apply** (this commit) — the
  theme headline's core: on a no-`.git` curl/product install, `jaeger update`
  downloads the target release tarball and swaps the PRODUCT files in place,
  keeping `.venv/` + `.jaeger_os/`; `--ref` pins, `--rollback` reverts, deps
  reinstall only when they change. Latest-version lookup (`version_check`) is
  shared with `jaeger doctor`'s current-vs-latest readout. Untracked 93 MB of
  derived Swift `.build/` (it had been dragged into every clone + install).
  *Remaining for the theme:* first-run model-download progress/ETA/resumable
  (the one sizable item) + an in-app update *action* (the surfaces show
  "available" but don't yet run the update for you).
- [x] **`jaeger autostart`** (this commit) — opt-in boot/login service so a
  deployed unit runs unattended after reboot/power-loss. macOS LaunchAgent +
  Linux `systemd --user` (+ linger). Manual `jaeger` start unchanged.
- [x] **README accuracy + lighter update download** (this commit) — `jaeger`
  documented as canonical, `jaeger update` upgrade path, character-pick wizard,
  badge bump; `.gitattributes export-ignore dev/` trims the release tarball.
- [x] **`jaeger uninstall` + `jaeger reinstall`** (this commit) — uninstall
  removes the framework (keeps agents unless `--purge`, refuses on a dev clone);
  reinstall does a clean in-place reinstall keeping agents. Completes the
  install → run → update → reinstall/uninstall lifecycle.
- [x] **Operator term: instance → agent** (surface only) — `jaeger agent
  <create|list|use|inspect|delete|clear>` unifies the old setup/instance/
  instances surface; `--agent` flag; `instance`/`setup`/`--instance` kept as
  aliases; internal `instances/` code unchanged.
- [x] **Mac `.app` launcher + in-app update surface** (this commit) — `jaeger
  launcher install` drops a clickable, locally-created (unsigned, no Gatekeeper
  prompt) `Jaeger.app`; the tray ("Check for Updates…") and Jaeger Studio (auto
  banner) both surface "update available" via `version_check.update_status`.

**Agentic (off-theme, operator-prioritised):**

- [x] **Person index** — profiles of people the agent knows (name/handles/access/
  likes/facts), grown like skills; folds into the admin trust model.
- [x] **Admin trust + channel-agnostic polish** — per-channel admin gating,
  in-channel approvals + `/mode` slash + receipt ack shared across
  telegram/discord/imessage.
- [x] **Autonomy modes (`ask` / `scoped` / `auto`)** — execution autonomy as a
  switchable mode (default `scoped`): agree the plan up front, then run the loop
  without per-action prompts; reach out (`clarify`) only when missing info or
  out of agreed scope. `/ask` `/scoped` `/auto` on every channel.
- [x] **Packaging — editable install** (`3f4b693`) — JROS is a proper package
  again (`uv pip install -e .`), code unmoved. Real `jaeger --version`, deps +
  version single-sourced. **Partially delivers the Update headline below**:
  `jaeger update` = `git pull --ff-only` + editable reinstall.
- [x] **Entry-point unification** (`dc1809f`) — one `jaeger` dispatcher behind
  the console script + the `./jaeger` wrapper.
- [x] **Model defaults from a clean 7-model benchmark** (`ea8c309`) — `normal`
  → e4b (voice), `high`/`deep-sleep` → 26B-A4B QAT, 12B = voice backup; bench
  tooling un-rotted. New-instance defaults (`DEFAULT_MODEL` + host_recommendation)
  aligned to match.
- [x] **Skill self-improvement loop** (`4be104b`, `4a5b345`, + this commit) —
  per-use notes journal → threshold/agent trigger → measured Deep Think rewrite
  (smoke + benchmark, keep-if-better) → revision log. **On by default (opt-out)**;
  `jaeger skills notes` / `revisions` surface it.
